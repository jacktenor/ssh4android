This repo is for personal use. Your welcome to checkout SSH4Android but
as of now it connects insecurely and may contain bugs.                                                                              
SSH4Android has 3 options, run a command via SSH, send a file, and pull a file.
The code in version 2 is written almost entirely by Chat GPT 3.5 and he was unenthusiastic
about it.

You should be able to build SSH4Android.apk by using the command...

git clone https://github.com/jacktenor/ssh4android2

Then from the Android Studio welcome screen choose "Open an Existing Project".                                
Navigate to and highlight the "SSH4Android" directory you cloned.                      
Click "ok" and after it's imported use the build menu to build it.                                      
I'm sure theres a better way but that worked for me.
